# A simple example that copies all tables from a SQLite database. The first few settings are
# required for all connectors: a name, the connector class to run, and the maximum number of
# tasks to create:
name=fhir-groupby-gp-gender-mysql-sink
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector
tasks.max=1

topics=FHIR_GROUPBY_GP_GENDER

fields.whitelist=TS,NPI,PATIENT_GENDER,CNT
pk.fields=NPI

key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
key.converter.schemas.enable=false
key.converter.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8081
value.converter=io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter
value.converter.schemas.enable=true
value.converter.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8081

# The remaining configs are specific to the JDBC source connector. In this example, we connect to a
# SQLite database stored in the file test.db, use and auto-incrementing column called 'id' to
# detect new rows as they are added, and output to topics prefixed with 'test-sqlite-jdbc-', e.g.
# a table called 'users' will be written to the topic 'test-sqlite-jdbc-users'.

# Define when identifiers should be quoted in DDL and DML statements.
# The default is 'always' to maintain backward compatibility with prior versions.
# Set this to 'never' to avoid quoting fully-qualified or simple table and column names.
